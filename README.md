<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This projects renders a list of user via the table. The form submission and update are handle via ajax

### Built With

This progam was made using this technologies

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Ruby
  You can easily install Ruby on your Linux computer by using [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/) and [Chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby)

```sh
brew install chruby
brew install ruby-install
ruby-install ruby
```

- Rails
  You can easily install Rails by using [the odin project's giude](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/your-facebook-clonelication) or directly from the [rails site](https://rubyonrails.org/)

```sh
  gem install rails
```

### Installation

<!-- 1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com) -->

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:abruzy/user-page.git
```

2. The next thing is to change directory folder

```sh
cd user-page
```

3. The next step is to install our dependencies by running the following command below

```sh
bundle install
```

```sh
yarn install
```

4. create a file called '.env' in your root directory and copy the field below and paste it inside that .env file

```sh
DATABASE_NAME='yourdatabasename'
TEST_DATABASE_NAME='yourtestdatabasename'
DATABASE_USER='yourpostgresuser'
DATABASE_PASSWORD='yourpassword'
DATABASE_HOST='yourpostgreshost'
DATABASE_PORT='yourportnumber'
```

5. The next step is to run the command below

NB: please make sure you have pgadmin installed on your machine

```sh
rails db:create
```

6. The next step is to migrate to our database by running the following command

```sh
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

- Starting the rails server using `rails server` isn't ideal since we also want to run the assets-precompilation at the same time. We have a `Procfile` and `Procfile.dev` files set up for this. So you can start the **rails server** and the run **assets-precompilation** at the same time using the command below:

      PORT=3002 foreman start -f Procfile.dev

8. Now to view the app, we need to visit this url below and you can actually see this in your terminal when you start the server

```sh
http://localhost:3000/
```

## Tests

- Run `rspec` or `bundle exec rspec` to run all specs
- This generates coverage report that you can find under `/coverage`
- To view coverage in your browser, open `/coverage/index.html` after running specs

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

- click on the Add New User button, fill the details and click add

- you can also delete an existing user
- you see user that are active and ones that are not active
